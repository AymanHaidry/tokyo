## 🧠 Intelligence Module

Orbiton includes a pluggable intelligence system (`neuro_link_intel.py`) that handles:

- **NLP normalization** — "what's" → "what is", "exam board" → "exam mode"
- **Knowledge lookup** — constellations, moon phases, aviation facts
- **Wikimedia scraping** — live Wikipedia/Wiktionary queries
- **Contextual routing** — decides whether to search, calculate, or answer directly
