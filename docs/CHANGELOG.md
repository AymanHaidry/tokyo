- Multi-language support
- IoT integration
- Auth system (online accounts)
- Website for downloads and intel sharing

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- **Speech-to-math calculation** — `calculate` command no longer fails on spoken math
  - `MathNormalizer` converts words to digits ("two" → 2, "twenty five" → 25)
  - Spoken operators mapped to symbols ("times", "into", "x" → `*`, "divided by" → `/`, "squared" → `**2`)
  - `safe_eval` whitelist prevents code injection from malformed speech input
  - Fixes: `calculate 2 x 2`, `calculate two times`, `calculate 2 into` all now resolve correctly

### Changed
- `handle_calculate` in `kosmosic_orbiton.py` now routes through `MathNormalizer` instead of raw `eval()`
- `neuro_link_intel.py` exports `MathNormalizer` class

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- **FileDiff workflow** — added `GITHUB_TOKEN` env and `pull-requests: write` permission to fix `Missing required environment variables: GITHUB_TOKEN` error

### Changed
- **CI runs on all branches** — all 10 workflow files updated from `branches: [main, develop]` to `branches: ['*']`
  - compute, core-logic, filediff, integration, launch, pylint, python-tests, python-tests-per-file, system, url-engine
- **Pylint score visibility** — `pylint.yml` now prints score to CI logs via dedicated `Pylint Score` step

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed
- CI/CD pipeline now passes all 151 tests across 7 workflows
- Platform-aware subprocess mocking for Windows/Linux/macOS
- `Path.exists()` and `Path.is_dir()` mocking in launch tests
- Self-listening bug partially mitigated (TTS output no longer triggers random intel)

### Changed
- Test suite reorganized into 6 categories: core_logic, url_engine, compute, launch, system, integration
- Each category runs as separate CI job for visibility
- Pylint workflow added for code quality

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-07

### Removed
- **Constellations knowledge dataset** from built-in intelligence module
  - Orion, Ursa Major, Cassiopeia, Scorpius, Cygnus, Leo, Andromeda, Crux
  - Why: Reduces bundle size. Constellation queries now route to Wikimedia/Wikipedia REST API
  - Still built-in: Moon Phases, Aviation Facts, Space Facts

### Changed
- Cleaner `BUILTIN_INTEL` structure with one fewer nested dictionary
- Reduced memory footprint on startup
- Backward compatibility maintained for all other lookups

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Dedicated `neuro_link_intel.py` module** — separated NLP and knowledge processing from main application
- **Natural Language Processor (NLP)** layer:
  - Contraction expansion ("what's" → "what is")
  - Homophone correction ("exambored" → "exam mode", "hell" → "help")
  - Intent normalization and query cleanup
- **File Explorer integration** — folders open directly in Windows Explorer with numbered file list
- **Apple-style boot sequence** — minimalist "● → Loading → ✓ Ready" startup
- **Built-in knowledge base**:
  - Constellations (Orion, Ursa Major, Cassiopeia, Scorpius, Cygnus, Leo, Andromeda, Crux)
  - Moon Phases (8 phases with descriptions)
  - Aviation Facts (V1, V2, Mach, ICAO, Squawk, METAR, TAF, etc.)
  - Space Facts (ISS, Mars, Black Holes, Light Years, Big Bang, etc.)
- **Wikimedia integration** — Wikipedia REST API + caching for dynamic fact retrieval
- **Manual sleep and wake controls**:
  - Sleep: `sleep`, `go to sleep`, `shut down`
  - Wake: `Tokyo`, `wake`, `wake up`, `start`, `online`
- **Reboot system** — reliable relaunching via `subprocess.Popen` instead of `os.execl`

### Changed
- Removed automatic sleep functionality (no more `wake_misses` / `sleep_after_misses`)
- Orbiton remains active indefinitely until explicit sleep command
- Help recognition expanded: `help`, `hell`, `hellp`, `halp`, `helf`, `elpe`
- Exam mode recognition expanded: `exam mode`, `exambored`, `exambord`, `exum mode`, `eggsam mode`

### Fixed
- Reboot reliability on Windows
- Help command misheard variants now correctly routed

---

- URL launcher system (Google, YouTube, Maps, FlightRadar24, etc.)
- VS Code project launcher
- Aviation utilities (METAR, TAF, airport search, flight tracking)
- Calculator engine with natural language math
- File navigation features
- JBL headset workflow foundation
- Toxic motivation engine (roasts)

---
